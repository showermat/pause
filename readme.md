# Pause

This bit of assembly invokes `pause` and then exits 0.  `pause` is a Linux kernel system call that sleeps the process until it
receives a signal.  The point of this is to sleep forever on systems that don't support `sleep inf` (*cough*Alpine*cough*), which
can be useful as a container init process.  This functionality should really exist in Busybox or Tini, but until they get their acts
together, you're stuck doing a sleep loop or something else hacky, or downloading a little binary like this to do the job.  I
promise it won't add much weight to your Docker image.

Linux on x86-64.  That's all.
